# Fan mount

This is a custom mount for the 20mmx40mm blower fan (from the V2 build).  I have added a way to actually screw the fan to the mount, as well as made the shroud a bit thicker for sturdiness (without interfering with surrounding areas).  The fan model is from GrabCad and may not be 100% accurate.

It looks like 16mm M3 bolts should do for mounting the actual fan, and to connect the mount plate to the shroud you'll need some M2 bolts and M2 jam nuts.  (I am just using the ones that came with the smaller 30x10mm square blower fan from V1).

One thing to note about the ring version is that when parked, the ring must go between the two horizontal rails where the tools and wipers are mounted.  If they don't fit, try lowering the lower rail and cutting larger pieces of silicone for the wipers.
