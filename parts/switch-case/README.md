# AC Switch case

This is a cover for the on/off switch that goes in the back left corner of the printer.  You can use the same bolts to mount it, and just put some M5 heat inserts into the cover after printing.

The standalone version can be used if you don't have the panels yet, but it won't fit when the panels are there so there is another version for when the panels are installed.
