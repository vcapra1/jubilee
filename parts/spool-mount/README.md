# Spool mount

This is a way to mount 4 spools to the printer (2 on each side).  I bought 2 409mm 2040 extrusions to put on each side to mount these to, and added holes in the acrylic sides as well (see the updated panel designs).  You'll need 12mm M5 bolts for the spool mounts and 10mm M3 bolts as well as M3 nuts (lock nuts preferred) for the PTFE tube clips).
